# The Real Tour

Group project for the Digital Heritage and Multimedia 2024/25 course.

The aim of this project is to design an interactive application for children to help them explore the museums of the University of Bologna while learning through entertaining games to distinguish what is real from what is AI-generated.

The site of the project is live at [metamuses.github.io/the-real-tour](https://metamuses.github.io/the-real-tour).
